Design Choices:

Data Storage:

Task data is stored in a text file named "file2". Each task entry is formatted with fields such as ID, title, description, location, and completion status. This text-based storage simplifies file handling and allows easy modification of tasks.
User Interaction:

The program interacts with users through the command line interface (CLI). It prompts users for input using read commands and displays information using echo statements. This approach provides a simple and familiar interaction method for users.

Task Identification:

Tasks are uniquely identified using UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers) generated by uuidgen. This ensures that each task has a globally unique identifier, reducing the risk of conflicts or ambiguity.

Task Operations:

Users can create, update, delete, view, list, and search tasks. These operations cover common task management functionalities and provide users with comprehensive control over their tasks.

Code Organization:

Function Definitions:

Each task operation is implemented as a separate function (createtask, updatetask, deletetask, showtask, listtasks, searchtask). This modular approach improves code readability, maintainability, and reusability.

Main Script Logic:

The main script logic is organized using a case statement. Based on the command-line argument provided by the user, the script invokes the corresponding function to perform the desired task operation.

Input Handling:

Input handling is done using read commands to capture user input for various task operations. Users are prompted with clear messages to provide the required information.

Error Handling:

Error handling is integrated into each function to check for common issues such as missing task files or invalid input. Error messages are displayed to users using echo statements.

How to Run the Program:

Save the Script:

Copy the provided Bash script and save it to a file with a .sh extension, such as task_manager.sh.


Set Execution Permissions:

If necessary, set execution permissions for the script using the chmod command:

chmod +x task_manager.sh

Run the Program:

Execute the script from the command line:

./task_manager.sh [command]


Replace [command] with one of the available task management commands (createtask, updatetask, deletetask, showtask, listtasks, searchtask) based on the desired operation.

Follow Prompts:

Follow the prompts provided by the program to input necessary information for task operations, such as task title, description, ID, etc.

View Output:

After executing a command, the program will display relevant information or messages based on the operation performed.
